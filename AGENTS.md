## Continuity Ledger (compaction-safe)
Maintain a single Continuity Ledger for this workspace in `CONTINUITY.md`. The ledger is the canonical session briefing designed to survive context compaction; do not rely on earlier chat text unless it’s reflected in the ledger.

### How it works
- At the start of every assistant turn: read `CONTINUITY.md`, update it to reflect the latest goal/constraints/decisions/state, then proceed with the work.
- **After every file edit: update `CONTINUITY.md` immediately** to reflect the change before proceeding to the next task. Skipping this breaks session continuity and makes context unreliable.
- Keep it short and stable: facts only, no transcripts. Prefer bullets. Mark uncertainty as `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess).
- If you notice missing recall or a compaction/summary event: refresh/rebuild the ledger from visible context, mark gaps `UNCONFIRMED`, ask up to 1–3 targeted questions, then continue.

### `functions.update_plan` vs the Ledger
- `functions.update_plan` is for short-term execution scaffolding while you work (a small 3–7 step plan with pending/in_progress/completed).
- `CONTINUITY.md` is for long-running continuity across compaction (the “what/why/current state”), not a step-by-step task list.
- Keep them consistent: when the plan or state changes, update the ledger at the intent/progress level (not every micro-step).

### In replies
- Begin with a brief “Ledger Snapshot” (Goal + Now/Next + Open Questions). Print the full ledger only when it materially changes or when the user asks.

## Development flow (Go build cache workaround)

Some execution environments (e.g. Cursor sandbox) cannot write to Go’s default build cache location (macOS example: `~/Library/Caches/go-build`). In that case, Go commands may fail with errors like:

- `open ~/Library/Caches/go-build/...: operation not permitted`

Workaround: use repository-local cache/temp directories by setting `GOCACHE` and `GOTMPDIR`:

```bash
GOCACHE="$PWD/.gocache" GOTMPDIR="$PWD/.gotmp" go test ./...
GOCACHE="$PWD/.gocache" GOTMPDIR="$PWD/.gotmp" go run . --help
```

### `CONTINUITY.md` format (keep headings)
- Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Constraints/Assumptions:
- Key decisions:
- State:
- Done:
- Now:
- Next:
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
